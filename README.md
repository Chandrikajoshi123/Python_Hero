## Introduction
Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language. It's widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. This repository aims to provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to become a Python Hero.

## Getting Started
To get started with Python, you need to install Python on your computer. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/). Once installed, you can write and run Python code using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, VS Code, or even a simple text editor.

## Basic Concepts

### Variables
Variables are used to store data values. You can think of them as containers for data. For example:
```python
age = 20
name = "Chandrika"
```

### Data Types
Data types specify the type of data that a variable can hold. Common data types include:

- Integer: Whole numbers (e.g., 42)
- Float: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14)
- String: Text (e.g., "Hello, World!")
- Boolean: True or False values (e.g., True)

### Operators

Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Common operators include:

- Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /
- Comparison Operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
- Logical Operators: and, or, not
  
### Control Flow

Control flow statements allow you to control the execution of code based on conditions. Common control flow statements include:

- If Statement: Executes code if a condition is true.
```python

if age > 18:
    print("You are an adult.")

```
- For Loop: Iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, string)
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

- While Loop: Repeats code as long as a condition is true.
```python
  while age < 30:
    age += 1
  ```
